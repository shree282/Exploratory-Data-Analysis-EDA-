# Titanic EDA Project

## Overview
This project performs an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns, relationships, and factors affecting passenger survival.

## Steps Performed
1. **Data Loading & Inspection** – Checked data structure, types, and missing values.
2. **Data Cleaning** – Handled missing values, removed unnecessary columns, and adjusted data types.
3. **Univariate Analysis** – Plotted distributions for age, fare, and survival counts.
4. **Bivariate Analysis** – Examined survival relationships with gender, class, and age.
5. **Multivariate Analysis** – Used pairplots and heatmaps to explore correlations and trends.
6. **Observations & Summary** – Documented key insights from visualizations.

## Key Findings
- Females had a much higher survival rate than males.
- 1st class passengers were more likely to survive compared to lower classes.
- Higher fares were associated with better survival chances.
- Younger passengers showed slightly better survival odds.
- Correlation analysis showed fare and class were important survival factors.
